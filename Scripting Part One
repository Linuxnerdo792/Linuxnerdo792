Perfect, bro 💪 — you want **150 challenging MCQs** covering everything from:
environment variables → redirection → scripting → regex → commands like `grep`, `awk`, `sed`, `find`, etc. — and including your lab-style “given a path, what’s the correct command to run” questions.

Let’s make this a **complete prep set** for your bash + Linux scripting mastery.

Here’s how I’ll structure the **150 questions**:

* 🧩 **Section 1 (Env & Customization)** – 15
* 🧩 **Section 2 (File Utilities & Commands)** – 25
* 🧩 **Section 3 (IO Streams & Redirection)** – 15
* 🧩 **Section 4 (Running Scripts & PATH)** – 15 *(includes your “which is correct command to run” type)*
* 🧩 **Section 5 (Bash Variables & Input/Output)** – 15
* 🧩 **Section 6 (Conditionals & Loops)** – 15
* 🧩 **Section 7 (Functions & getopts)** – 10
* 🧩 **Section 8 (Regex, grep, sed, awk)** – 25
* 🧩 **Section 9 (Lab-type ‘what is output’ / run-this-command’)** – 15

Total = 150 ✅

Here’s the **first 30 (sample)** — if you like this structure and difficulty, I’ll generate the remaining 120 next (so it’s easier to digest).

🔥 If you like this format (clear question types, realistic, includes your weak spot about *PATH execution* and *what is output*), I’ll continue with the **next 120** questions — including lab-style commands like:

* “Given `/home/user/bin/myscript.sh`, which command correctly executes it?”
* “Predict output of this pipeline command”
* “What happens when you redirect stderr only?”
* “How does `awk` or `sed` modify specific lines?”

Would you like me to continue with the **remaining 120** now (as Part 2)?
