## Part 2 Answers

1. `chmod u+r bubbles.txt`
   
    - Means: It adds the read permission for the owner of bubbles.txt

    - Means:Here the owner gets full access, and the group can write read and others only can execute
   - Assessment:it is a god choice for an executable program where owner can edit, group can read, others can only run
5. `chmod -R ug+w share`
