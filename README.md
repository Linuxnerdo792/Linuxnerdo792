1. Full / absolute path to your user's home directory: /home/research i typed pwd i was already in home directory
2. Create a directory named `DirA`: mkdir 'DirA'
3. Create a directory named `Dir B`: mkdir 'Dir B'
4. Go into `DirA`: cd 'DirA'
5. Go into `Dir B` from `DirA`: cd .. (I will go in home directory ) and then i will type cd 'Dir B' (I will go in dir B)
6. Return to your user's home directory: cd ..
7. Create a file named `test.txt`: touch test.txt
